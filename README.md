# Hackathon7
The winner project in the Hackathon#7 competition in the Lev academic center
this software lets you map a person on a map based on a video file, and camera positioning data.
due to uni studies we were not able to continue the project, 
though we hope that soon we'll have some more time and well create a more riggid software out of it.
